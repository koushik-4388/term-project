### Align3 - a simple game
This repository covers the development of a simple board game step by step into a modular, maintainable and resuable code base.

### Running the game
Run the game with `python3 play.py`. If this fails you might need to install `python3-tk` library for your python version.

For debugging, you can open a module in the interpreter with the following command `python3 -i state.py`. Following this you can type commands related to state into the interpreter and see their result.

### Making your own game
When you run the command `pyhton3 play.py` you get a 5 X 5 board with 25 buttons in which there are 4 mines hidden inside the board.
The goal here is to select all the safe buttons avoiding the mines.
If you select a button which has a hidden mine you "LOSE" if you are lucky enough to select all the safe buttons you "WIN".

GOOD LUCK ! ENJOY YOURSELF PLAYING THIS GAME !
